/*! \mainpage BeeCrypt API Documentation.

Included in the library are:
    - entropy sources for initializing pseudo-random generators
    - pseudo-random generators: FIPS-186, Mersenne Twister
    - block ciphers: AES, Blowfish
    - hash functions: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256
    - keyed hash functions: HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-256
    - multi-precision integer library, with assembler-optimized routines
      for several processors
    - probabilistic primality testing, with optimized small prime trial
      division
    - discrete logarithm parameter generation over a prime field
    - Diffie-Hellman key agreement
    - DSA signature scheme
    - ElGamal signature scheme (two variants)
    - RSA keypair generation with chinese remainder theorem variables
    - RSA public & private key operations
    - DHAES encryption scheme

Planned for the near future are:
    - mp64 library for operation on 64-bit computers (and possibly also
      on certain 32-bit platforms)
    - compliance with and compliance statements for IEEE P1363
    - more blockciphers (Twofish, ... )
    - more hash functions (RIPEMD-160, SHA-384, SHA-512, HAVAL, Tiger)
    - RSA signatures as specified by RFC-2440.
    - Elliptic Curves (ECDSA, ... )
    - more blockcipher modes (OFB, ... )

The library has been tested on the following platforms:
    - FreeBSD 4.0 alpha
    - FreeBSD 4.0, 4.2 x86
        - includes assembler optimization (tuned for Pentium and higher)
    - Linux glibc 2.x alpha
    - Linux glibc 2.x arm
        - includes assembler optimization
    - Linux glibc 2.x ppc
        - includes assembler optimization for 32-bit PowerPC
     - Linux glibc 2.x sparc
        - includes assembler optimization for Sparc v8
    - Linux glibc 2.x x86
        - includes assembler optimization (tuned for Pentium and higher)
    - Solaris 2.6/2.7/2.8 sparc (with Forte or gnu compilers)
        - includes assembler optimization for Sparc v8, v8plus and v9
    - Solaris 2.7/2.8 x86 (with Forte or gnu compilers)
        - includes assembler optimization (tuned for Pentium and higher)
    - Tru64 Unix alpha
    - Win32 (Windows 95, 98, NT 4.0, 2000)
        - includes assembler optimization (tuned for Pentium and higher)

The library is currently in the process of being ported to:
    - Darwin (apparently Apple has decided to change the PPC assembler format;
      this will need a fix)
    - Cygwin (the DLL builds now, but needs to be tested)
