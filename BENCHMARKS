Note: timings are average values and may vary under different conditions,
i.e. the amount of free memory, swapped memory, amount of cpu cache, etc.
I've tried to make them as accurate as possible, within limits.

Note: many of the testing systems were provided by HP's testdrive program;
many thanks to them for giving me access to their systems.
